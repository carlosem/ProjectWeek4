The script does the following:

1 - Read the Features and find out each collums have observations with mean and standart deviation, then extract the respective id's and name of the collums.
      
2 - Read the test set and select the appropriate observations from the previous steps. (It involved reading the files subject_test.txt, y_test.txt, X_test.txt and merging them). Do the same thing with the trainning set.
      
3 - Using descriptive names for the activities in the data set.

4 - Merging the data sets.

5 - Creating a new tidy data set (tidy_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

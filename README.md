The script responsible for cleaning up the data is in the run_analysis.R 

The data sets used are in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

The other files can be ignored.

## NOTE: I performed the analysis following a different order from the one on the instructions of the exercise, because I think it has a better flow for the programming and it is more intuitive

The script responsible for cleaning up the data is in the run_analysis.R 

The data sets used are in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

The file CodeBook.md describes how I cleaned up the data, what features of the data 
I used and gives more additional information about the process.

The other files can be ignored.
